# Security policy

> Note: this policy is new and untested. We’ll update and polish it as we’re receiving security issues.

## Scope

If you believe you’ve found a security issue in any software, service, or
website governed by varunsridharan, we encourage you to notify us.

There are no hard and fast rules to determine if a bug is worth reporting as a
security issue or a “regular” issue.
When in doubt, please do send us a report.

## How to submit a report

Security issues can be reported by sending an email to `varunsridharan23@gmail.com`, I acknowledge your email within 48 hours. You will receive a more detailed response within 96 hours.

I will create a maintainer security advisory on GitHub to discuss internally, and when needed, invite you to the advisory.

## Preferences

*   Please provide detailed reports with reproducible steps and a clearly defined impact
*   Submit one vulnerability per report
*   Social engineering (such as phishing, vishing, smishing) is prohibited
